# ### Problem 6
# Create a class called ClubMember 
# Each club member has a name and a role  
# Create ClubMember instances for the following people:
# ```
# Alfred - Club President
# Troy - Club Vice President
# Albert - Club Secretary
# Bob - Club Treasurer
# ```
# Add each member instance to a new club_members list that you create.
# Write the code needed to loop through the club member list and print the current number of members in the list, then the memberâ€™s name and club role, one per line using f strings.

# Example Output:
# ```
# There are currently 4 club members in the list!

# Club President: Alfred
# Club Vice President: Troy
# Club Secretary: Albert
# Club Treasurer: Bob
# ```

# create class for clubmember with print method
class Clubmember:
    def __init__(self, name, role):
        self.name = name
        self.role = role
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name} {self.role} \n"

# create multiple instances of Clubmember
mem1 = Clubmember("Alfred", "Club President")
mem2 = Clubmember(" Troy", "Club Vice President")
mem3 = Clubmember("Albert", "Club Secretary")
mem4 = Clubmember("Bob", "Club Treasurer")

# create list of club members
newclubmembers = [mem1, mem2, mem3, mem4]

# create for loop that iterates through each index and prints name of members
for each in range(len(newclubmembers)):
    print(newclubmembers[each])
    # print(f"{newclubmembers[0]}"
    #       f"{newclubmembers[1]}"
    #       f"{newclubmembers[2]}"
    #       f"{newclubmembers[3]}")
